Introduction:
The project we took was about developing a Sudoku game using what we had been taught in the course. Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle game that originated in Japan. It is played on a grid of 9 x 9 squares, divided into nine 3 x 3 sub-grids, or "boxes." The objective is to fill in the grid with the numbers 1 through 9 in such a way that each row, column, and box contains all of the numbers from 1 to 9, with no repeats.
